            <p><br><br>Hi, I'm Maddy. Welcome to my world. I'm 18 years old and I live in Los Angeles with my mom, who is a doctor. I have a rare condition called SCID, which means I can't go outside or have contact with anyone who might make me sick. I spend most of my time in my white room, reading books, watching movies, and learning new things online. I also love architecture and I make models of buildings that I dream of visiting someday.</p>
